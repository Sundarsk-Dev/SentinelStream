mplemented Project Components
Project Structure & Dockerization 📂: We successfully defined and used a standardized project folder structure. We also established a docker-compose.yml file to orchestrate multiple services, including Kafka, Zookeeper, Redis, a FastAPI server, and a PyFlink job manager. This created a reproducible and portable development environment.

Data Ingestion Pipeline (Kafka Producer) ⚙️: We developed the core data ingestion script (producer.py) that generates synthetic transaction data. This script is capable of sending these transactions as messages to a Kafka topic, acting as the starting point of your real-time data pipeline.

Real-Time Feature Engineering (PyFlink Job) 📊: We created a fundamental Apache Flink job (flink_job.py) that reads the stream of transactions from Kafka. This job performs real-time feature computation, specifically calculating a velocity feature (the total transaction amount for a user over a short time window).

Real-Time Feature Caching (Redis) 💾: The PyFlink job is configured to write the computed velocity features to a Redis in-memory database. This step is crucial for enabling low-latency lookups of real-time features.

Real-Time Model Serving API (FastAPI) 🚀: We developed a FastAPI application (api.py) that serves your machine learning model. This API is not only capable of making predictions but is also integrated with Redis. Before making a prediction, it retrieves the real-time velocity feature from Redis and combines it with the incoming transaction data, enabling your model to use the most up-to-date features.
