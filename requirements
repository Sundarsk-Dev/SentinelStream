SentinelStream â€” Real-Time Fraud Intelligence: Updated Implementation Plan
This refined plan prioritizes a phased approach, building from a minimal viable product (MVP) to a fully-featured, production-ready system. This ensures you have a working system at each stage and helps manage complexity.

Key Changes Incorporated:

Phased Implementation: Explicitly broken down into 5 phases as suggested.

Avro/Protobuf Early: Emphasized early adoption of schema for Kafka.

Flink/Kafka Streams Choice: Acknowledged Kafka Streams as a potential MVP for stream processing before Flink.

Redis Usage: Clarified Redis's role primarily for caching rolling aggregates and quick lookups.

Explainability: Mentioned SHAP/LIME for explainable outputs.

Phase 1: Ingestion & Basic Pipeline (MVP) ðŸš€
Goal: Establish the core data ingestion, a simple rule-based fraud check, and get data flowing end-to-end.

Environment Setup (VS Code Focus):

Install Docker & Docker Compose: Crucial first step on your local machine.

Install VS Code Extensions: Python, Docker, Apache Kafka, YAML, Remote - Containers.

Create Project Structure: Initialize the sentinelstream/ directory with docker-compose.yaml, src/, data/, notebooks/, etc. as outlined previously. Use poetry or pip-tools for Python dependency management within src/.

Docker Compose Stack (Minimum Local Services):

Action: Create docker-compose.yaml to spin up Apache Kafka (with Zookeeper or KRaft) and Confluent Schema Registry. Add a minimal Redis for future use.

Test: docker-compose up -d and verify containers are running.

Schema Definition (Avro/Protobuf):

Action: Define Avro/Protobuf schemas for your transactions data in src/stream_ingestion/schemas/transaction.avsc (or .proto).

Rationale: Using Avro/Protobuf from the start ensures strict typing and future compatibility.

Stream Ingestion (src/stream_ingestion/producer.py):

Action: Write a Python script to read from PaySim/Kaggle ULB (local data/raw/).

Activity: Serialize data using the defined Avro/Protobuf schema (interacting with Schema Registry) and publish records to the transactions Kafka topic with simulated delays.

Test: Run the producer and verify messages appear in Kafka using a consumer.

Basic Rule-Based Fraud Detection (src/rule_engine/simple_consumer.py):

Action: Create a Python script acting as a Kafka consumer.

Activity: Consume from transactions topic, deserialize messages. Implement a simple rule (e.g., if amount > $10,000 or user_id in known_bad_list).

Output: Log suspicious transactions to the console or a local file. This serves as your initial "fraud detection."

Test: Verify suspicious transactions are identified and logged.

Phase 2: ML Model Serving âœ¨
Goal: Integrate a trained Machine Learning model for fraud scoring via a real-time API.

Model Training (Colab Focus: notebooks/training/01_baseline_training.ipynb):

Action: Load Kaggle ULB dataset.

Activity: Train a Logistic Regression and/or Random Forest classifier. Focus on metrics like AUPRC. Use imbalanced-learn for handling class imbalance.

Serialization: Serialize the trained model using joblib (or convert to ONNX if you want to optimize for serving speed early). Save the model to src/model_serving/models/.

FastAPI Model Serving API (src/model_serving/api.py):

Action: Create a FastAPI application.

Activity:

Load the pre-trained model at startup.

Expose a /score endpoint that accepts transaction details.

Perform direct inference using the received data (no real-time features from Redis/Flink yet, use raw data or simple derived features for now).

Return the fraud score.

Containerization: Create a Dockerfile for this FastAPI service and add it to your docker-compose.yaml.

Integrate Consumer with API (src/rule_engine/consumer_with_api.py):

Action: Modify your Phase 1 Python consumer.

Activity: Instead of just rule-based checks, send each transaction (or a sample) as a request to your local FastAPI /score endpoint. Log the returned fraud score.

Test: Send simulated transactions, observe scores from the API in your consumer logs.

Phase 3: Real-Time Features âš¡
Goal: Implement real-time feature computation using Flink and leverage Redis for caching.

MaxMind GeoLite2 Integration:

Action: Download the GeoLite2 database.

Activity: Develop a simple script to load relevant IP-to-geo mappings into Redis (or store the .mmdb file for direct lookup in Flink/Python).

Stream Processing & Enrichment (PyFlink Job: src/stream_processing/flink_job.py):

Action: Write an Apache Flink (PyFlink) job.

Activity:

Consume from the transactions Kafka topic.

Feature Computation: Implement in-flight features like:

Velocity Features: Rolling averages of amount/count per user_id, merchant, IP/device (e.g., last 5 min, 1 hour).

Geo/IP Anomalies: Perform lookups against GeoLite2 data (from Redis or a Flink lookup table).

Hour-of-day, etc.

State Management: Use Flink's internal state (RocksDB) for efficient windowing.

Feature Output: Push computed and enriched features to Redis, keyed by transaction ID or user ID for fast lookup.

Containerization: Add the Flink service to your docker-compose.yaml.

Test: Deploy the Flink job and verify features are correctly written to Redis.

Update Model Serving API (src/model_serving/api.py):

Action: Modify the FastAPI service.

Activity: When a /score request comes in, retrieve the pre-computed features from Redis based on the transaction ID. Feed these richer features to the ML model for scoring.

Note: You might need to retrain your model in Colab (notebooks/training/02_rf_training_paysim.ipynb) using a dataset with similar features to what Flink will produce.

Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerts ðŸš¨
Goal: Gain operational visibility and establish real-time alerting mechanisms.

Prometheus & Grafana Setup:

Action: Ensure Prometheus and Grafana are included in your docker-compose.yaml.

Activity: Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from Kafka (using JMX Exporter), FastAPI (using FastAPI's Prometheus integration), and Flink.

Grafana Dashboards: Create dashboards to visualize:

Kafka ingest rates and consumer lag.

FastAPI request rates, latency (p50/p95/p99), and error rates.

Flink metrics (backpressure, checkpointing, taskmanager health).

Basic fraud rate from alerts.

Kafka Alert Topic:

Action: Define a fraud_alerts Kafka topic (if not already done).

Activity: Modify the FastAPI model serving service to publish high-risk events (above a defined threshold) as detailed alert messages to the fraud_alerts Kafka topic.

Alert & Action Layer (src/alert_action/alert_consumer.py):

Action: Create a dedicated Python Kafka consumer.

Activity: Consume messages from the fraud_alerts topic. Parse the alerts and dispatch notifications to Slack via webhooks.

Explainability: Incorporate SHAP (for tabular models) in your FastAPI service. When a high-risk alert is generated, include SHAP-derived feature contributions in the alert message for the analyst.

Test: Trigger high-risk transactions and verify alerts appear on Grafana dashboards and in Slack.

Phase 5: Full MLOps ðŸ”„
Goal: Implement robust MLOps practices for model lifecycle management, data quality, and drift detection.

MLflow for Experiment Tracking & Registry:

Action: Add MLflow tracking server to docker-compose.yaml (or use a simple file-based backend to start).

Activity:

Modify all Colab training notebooks (notebooks/training/) to log parameters, metrics (AUPRC, precision, recall), and artifacts (trained models, plots) to MLflow.

Utilize MLflow's Model Registry to register and version trained models after successful evaluation.

DVC for Data Versioning:

Action: Initialize DVC in your project (dvc init).

Activity: Use DVC to version your datasets (data/raw/, data/processed/) and models (src/model_serving/models/). This ensures reproducibility of your experiments.

Great Expectations for Data Quality:

Action: Set up Great Expectations (mlops/data_validation/).

Activity: Define expectations for the schema and content of your Kafka transactions data (e.g., user_id not null, amount positive). Implement a Python script or Flink job to run these checks periodically on sampled data or during ingestion.

Evidently AI for Drift Detection:

Action: Set up Evidently AI (mlops/model_drift/).

Activity: Regularly collect samples of features consumed by your model serving API (from Redis or a Kafka topic). Compare these production feature distributions against your training data. Generate Evidently AI drift reports (feature drift, target drift, Prediction Shift Index - PSI) to identify when models might need retraining due to data shifts.

Alerting: Integrate drift alerts (e.g., via Slack) if defined thresholds are breached.

Automated Retraining & Deployment (Conceptual/Future):

Activity: While primarily manual for an MVP, this phase lays the groundwork for:

Triggering model retraining based on drift alerts or a schedule.

Promoting new model versions in MLflow.

Automating model deployment to the FastAPI service.
