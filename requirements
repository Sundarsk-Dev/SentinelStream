🚀 SentinelStream – Real-Time Fraud Intelligence System
✅ Strengths in Your Plan

You already covered end-to-end lifecycle:

Data ingestion → Stream processing → Feature engineering → ML inference → Monitoring → Alerts.

Excellent choice of tools: Kafka + Flink + Redis + FastAPI is a battle-tested combo for real-time ML inference.

Inclusion of MLOps tooling (MLflow, DVC, Great Expectations, Evidently AI) shows production-grade thinking.

Choice of datasets is smart (Kaggle Fraud → PaySim → synthetic augmentations).

📍 Suggested Improvements

Scope Phasing (MVP → Advanced)
Don’t start with the full stack at once. Break into phases:

Phase 1 (MVP): Kafka ingestion → Python consumer → simple fraud detection (rule-based).

Phase 2: Add ML model serving with FastAPI.

Phase 3: Add Flink for streaming features + Redis cache.

Phase 4: Add monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana, Evidently AI).

Phase 5: Full MLOps integration (MLflow, DVC, Great Expectations).

This way you’ll have a working system at each stage.

Kafka + Schema Registry
Instead of JSON messages, use Avro/Protobuf early on → ensures strict typing and forward/backward compatibility.

Stream Processing Choice

Flink is powerful, but complex to deploy.

If you’re new, start with Kafka Streams (in Python via Faust or Java), then migrate to Flink later.

Confluent provides ksqlDB (SQL-like Kafka queries) → great for prototyping fraud rules fast.

Redis Placement
Redis should be used mainly for:

Caching rolling aggregates (e.g., last 5 transactions by user).

Quick lookups during FastAPI inference (geo-IP, velocity checks).
But don’t overuse it — Flink can handle most feature calculations.

Explainability & Alerts
Fraud systems need why a transaction was flagged. Add:

SHAP/LIME for explainable ML outputs.

Alerts via Kafka → Slack/email integration.

🛠️ Final Tech Stack (Refined)

Ingestion: Kafka + Schema Registry (Avro/Protobuf).

Stream Processing: Flink (or Kafka Streams as MVP).

Features & State: Redis (fast cache), Postgres (historical).

Model Serving: FastAPI + Docker.

Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana + Evidently AI.

MLOps: MLflow (experiments + registry), DVC (data versioning), Great Expectations (data quality).

Enrichment: MaxMind GeoLite2.

📊 Suggested Project Roadmap
🔹 Phase 1: Ingestion & Basic Pipeline

Simulate transactions (PaySim/Kaggle) → produce to Kafka.

Consume with Python → log to console.

Add rule-based fraud checks (e.g., > $10,000 = suspicious).

🔹 Phase 2: ML Model Serving

Train baseline model (scikit-learn, XGBoost).

Wrap in FastAPI → Dockerize.

Consumer sends transactions to API → returns fraud score.

🔹 Phase 3: Real-Time Features

Add Flink for rolling aggregates (transaction velocity, amount per user).

Store features in Redis → API reads features → model inference.

🔹 Phase 4: Monitoring & Alerts

Prometheus collects metrics (latency, throughput, fraud %).

Grafana dashboard → visualize fraud spikes.

Kafka alert topic → send Slack alerts.

🔹 Phase 5: Full MLOps

Track model experiments in MLflow.

Use DVC for dataset versioning.

Great Expectations for schema validation.

Evidently AI for drift detection.

🎯 End Result

You’ll have:

A real-time fraud detection system capable of ingesting thousands of transactions per second.

A production-ready ML pipeline with monitoring and MLOps.

A portfolio project that proves you can work at the level of an SDE / ML Engineer in fintech.
